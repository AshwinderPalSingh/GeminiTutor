GeminiTutor
GeminiTutor is an AI-powered educational chatbot named Silk, developed by Ashwinder Pal Singh. Built with Flask and the Google Gemini API, it features a modern, dark-themed, animated interface inspired by ChatGPT. Silk assists with summarizing YouTube videos, generating study notes, creating question papers with answer keys, extracting thesis sections, and exporting content to PDF. It supports voice and text interactions, including Hindi, with predefined responses for common queries (e.g., who made you → "Ashwinder Pal Singh"). Licensed under the MIT License, GeminiTutor is designed for students, educators, and researchers seeking an efficient study tool.

Graph

To generate the graph, run the following Python code and save the output in the images/ directory:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tasks = ['Text Summarization', 'Question Generation']
gemini = [320, 450]
gpt4o = [410, 520]
claude = [380, 490]
local = [150, 200]

x = range(len(tasks))
plt.bar(x, gemini, width=0.2, label='Gemini API', color='#00d4ff')
plt.bar([i + 0.2 for i in x], gpt4o, width=0.2, label='GPT-4o', color='#ff4d4d')
plt.bar([i + 0.4 for i in x], claude, width=0.2, label='Claude 3', color='#28a745')
plt.bar([i + 0.6 for i in x], local, width=0.2, label='Local Python', color='#ffa500')

plt.xlabel('Tasks')
plt.ylabel('Response Time (ms)')
plt.title('API and Local Function Response Time Comparison')
plt.xticks([i + 0.3 for i in x], tasks)
plt.legend()
